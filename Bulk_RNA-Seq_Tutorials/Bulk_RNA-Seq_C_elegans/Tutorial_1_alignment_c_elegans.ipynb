Steps in the workflow include read trimming, read QC, read mapping, and counting mapped reads per gene to quantitate gene expression. This tutorial workflow uses truncated and partial run data from the Rochester JD et al. project.\n",

    "This tutorial can take over 17 minutes to run the code fully, with a `ml.t3.medium` instance, because of the limited memory we are using a subsampled dataset from Rochester JD et al. from chr I and 1,000,000 reads each sample. This is part of the reason we have a short and easy introductory tutorial, but provide a longer more full tutorial for those interested."

    "Miniforge is a lightweight Conda distribution that offers a streamlined installation process and efficient package management. It provides access to a vast repository of packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda packages and environments are useful for several reasons. Conda packages contain metadata. This metadata includes information about what other programs the given software needs to be installed, in order to run. When installing a package with Conda, those other packages are automatically also installed. In this way, the user does not have to worry about manually installing each dependency. This makes installation quick and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages are installed inside of environments, which are simply folders within the local installation of Conda. This has several benefits. Local installation means easier installation for non-admin users who may not have access to all system directories. Each environment can hold specific software with specific versions, and it easy to swap to different environments. In addition, the environments themselves are portable, as each environment contains a manifest on how to recreate that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniforge itself is a Conda package manager, this means it requires Conda in order to work. It is used to install and update Conda packages, which it gets from a ‘channel’, or repository. It is an alternative to the native Conda package manager. It is often used for reasons of speed.\n",

Unless there is a significant amount of them, or a specific reason to use them, it is generally easier to discard unpaired reads.

    "FastQC is an invaluable tool that allows you to evaluate whether there are problems with a set of reads. For example, it will provide a report of whether there is any bias in the sequence composition of the reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because jupyter is at its core a python editor, we can use python code and html support to display results in-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastQC looks for different characteristics of quality in reads. It is very rare that every metric will pass. In many cases, they serve as warnings, which should be compared to the context of the experiment. For instance, here, per base sequence content, sequence length distribution, sequence duplication levels, and overrepresented sequences all throw warnings. Per base sequence content routinely fails in RNA-sequencing in the first 15~ or so bases due to biased fragmentation. In most of our samples, this is where we see the failure (20% or more difference between A/T or G/C), and so is not unexpected. The overrepresented sequences can be BLASTed to show the majority of them are ribosomal RNA. Ribosomal RNA contamination is also common and will not be indexed later, and so not a large concern. Other metrics look good."

    "The provided code snippet demonstrates the process of preparing a reference genome and annotation files for RNA-Seq analysis using RSEM and STAR. The initial command, rsem-prepare-reference, creates a reference index for the C. elegans genome based on the provided GTF annotation file (celegans_annotation.gtf). This index, along with the reference genome sequence (celegans_genome.fa), is essential for quantifying gene and isoform expression using RSEM. The --star option ensures compatibility with STAR, a popular transcriptome aligner.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the subsequent STAR genome generation step encounters a warning due to an excessively large --genomeSAindexNbases parameter. This parameter controls the size of the genome's suffix array index, which is used for efficient alignment. If the parameter is too large for the given genome size, it can lead to segmentation faults during the mapping process. To address this issue, the code adjusts the --genomeSAindexNbases parameter to 12, which is more appropriate for the C. elegans genome. This modification ensures that the STAR genome generation process completes successfully without errors."
